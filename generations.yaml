    description: "The Zeekr 009 is the second production model from Zeekr, the premium electric vehicle brand of Chinese automotive giant Geely. Introduced in 2023, the 009 is a full-size luxury MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) with a distinctive and bold design featuring a massive illuminated grille, split headlight arrangement, and a clean, monolithic side profile with power-operated sliding doors. Built on Geely's Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), the 009 is powered by a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 536 horsepower (400 kW), enabling acceleration from 0-100 km/h in 4.5 secondsâ€”remarkable performance for a large MPV. Two battery options are available: a 116 kWh standard battery providing approximately 702 km (436 miles) of range on the CLTC cycle, and a 140 kWh Qilin battery developed by CATL offering up to 822 km (511 miles). The interior focuses on luxury and comfort with a 2+2+2 seating configuration, featuring captain's chairs in the first and second rows with heating, ventilation, massage functions, and extensive adjustment options. Premium materials including Nappa leather, wood, and metal trim create a sophisticated environment. Technology is comprehensive with a 15.6-inch central touchscreen, 10.25-inch instrument cluster, multiple additional screens for rear passengers, advanced driver assistance systems, and an audiophile-grade 20-speaker Yamaha sound system. The Zeekr 009 demonstrates the growing sophistication of Chinese luxury electric vehicles, combining premium appointments and advanced technology with impressive electric performance in a distinctive MPV package. Initially launched in China, the 009 may expand to international markets as part of Zeekr's global ambitions."
